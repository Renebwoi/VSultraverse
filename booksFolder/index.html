            <p> SOMEWHERE in the vast void of space....</p>
            <p>Kronox’s space craft burst through a wormhole. The ship was smoking and spiraling out of control, inside the ship kronox was at the deck franticly pressing different buttons trying to get the ship under control.</p>
            <p>"Krox, what’s the status of the ship?",</p>
            <p>Krox was the AI designated for kronox's ship.</p>
            <p>"Sir the ship's engines sustained considerable damage, navigation and landing protocols are offline as well",</p>
            <p>"So that means that we'll be crashlanding"</p>
            <p>"Precisely sir."</p>
            <p>"But can we still make it to our destination?"</p>
            <p>"I believe so sir."</p>
            <p>"Then prepare the pod."</p>
            <p>Looking at the main screen of his ship kronox saw earth's silver outline as he approached the planet hoping he would complete his mission, his life and probably his entire planet depended on it.</p>
            <p><i>..to be continued...</i></p>



            <h3 class="aurheading">THE AURORA</h3>
        <p>Spencer groaned in anguish as the alarm clock beside his bed reminded him that it was Monday morning. He reached for his bedside table and felt around until he touched the alarm clock which he then silenced with a bang. He pulled off the sleeping mask which he wore every day and bright sunlight streamed into his eyes blinding him for a moment. When his eyes adjusted to the light, he glanced at his alarm clock which displayed 8:05 in flashing red numbers. Sitting up the first thing spencer saw was his backpack sitting on top of his drawer, spencer sighed as he remembered that he had a biology quiz that morning. Yesterday he was up until around half past two in the morning studying for the unexpected test. He was glad when he remembered that he was in his last year of high school, in six months he would be free of the Monday morning fever which commonly affected most high school students, after then he would worry about attending lectures on time since he had gotten admitted to California state university one of the best ivy league institutions in America. He had been given a scholarship for his performance in the regional state championships earlier that trimester. Spencer stood up and went to the bathroom, brushed his teeth, and stepped into the shower for a quick warm bath. When he finished, he went to his wardrobe and pulled out a pair of black jeans and a red long-sleeved SanFrancisco 49ers shirt not that he was a big fan of football, he just liked the feel of the soft cotton shirt on his skin. After dressing up he grabbed his sweater and headed downstairs for breakfast where he met his mom setting the table</p>
        <p>"Good morning mom." </p>
        <p>"Morning sweetie ready for school?"</p>
        <p>"yeah", spencer replied as he grabbed a bowl and filled it with his favorite rice crispies cereal. 
            He went to the kitchen where the fridge was and opened it surveying its contents until he found what he was looking for. 
            He reached in and pulled out a carton of milk. On his way back to the table got a spoon from the kitchen counter and settled down to have a quick meal.</p>
        <p>"Are you going to work today?", he muttered in-between mouthfuls of cereal.</p>
        <p>"No baby, it's my day off. I am going shopping later today. Anything the matter?"</p>
        <p>"Well not really, I going to Lucy's after school so don't worry if I don't come back early."</p>
        <p>"Ok sweetie, you want me to drive you to school?"</p>
        <p>"Don't worry mom, I’ll take my bike."</p>
        <p>Two minutes later spencer was on his Suzuki GSX-R750 motorcycle and speeding towards his school. When he arrived, he took the motorcycle to a workshop opposite the school, the mechanic there was the old man Clinton. 
            Occasionally his son Chris came to the workshop. He and spencer were good friends; Spencer always dropped his bike there to avoid any funny stories after school. He left after greeting Chris' dad. 
            The school was already buzzing with activity; he hadn't gone more than thirty meters when his phone buzzed inside his back pocket. 
            He paused and brought it out, the message was from an unknown number, the same number he had been receiving strange messages from. It read: </p>
        <p><i>'UFO just crashed in the Antarctic, check it out before the world’s governments realize what it is and get interested. It may have something to do with your abilities.'</i></p>
        <p>At the bottom there were coordinates attached. He wondered why his anonymous benefactor bothered to help him at all. 
            He had given up trying to have a casual conversation with this faceless being that seemed to follow his every step. 
            Every time he tried to call or text, it wouldn't go through because there was no number to contact. 
            He figured it was pointless to keep on trying since his mysterious helper had not asked anything of him or tried to blackmail him. 
            He just prayed it stayed that way since the government was already trying to catch him.</p> 
            
        <p>Two years ago, he had saved a passenger aircraft that was about to crash into the Hudson River - its engines had failed just after takeoff. 
            He happened to be flying by at the time and realized what was happening, he carried the aircraft back to the airport and dropped it some distance from the landing strip. 
            There were soldiers at the airport at that time and apparently they didn't take kindly to an unknown 17 year old boy wearing a motorcycle helmet and black sweater who was 
            flying around saving people without being registered by the American government.</p>
            
            
        <p>They had tried to shoot him down with an anti-aircraft missile when he flew away but without luck as they couldn't get a lock on him as he wasn't an aircraft. 
            His life had been like this since his sixteenth birthday. That was when he discovered his powers after he fell off the roof of a seventy-five-story high scrapper without splattering all over the sidewalk. 
            After two minutes went by, he opened his eyes and realized he was floating in midair.</p>


        <p>Scared shitless he managed to push himself toward the roof and pushed his feet back towards the ground. No way he was telling his mom, she would freak out. 
            Luckily, it was night so no one saw him. Returning to the present he made a mental note to check out the place.</p>

        <p class="bigSectionP">Meanwhile somewhere in the Antarctic, kronox opened his eyes and realized he was on the floor, he stood up and looked around the spaceship which had sparks fly out here and there, there was smoke in the air due to his overheated systems, apart from a cracked main screen and a few broken lights the ship didn't seem to sustain much damage though he couldn't be sure until he took a look outside. He trudged to a corner of the bridge where the display was still working, 
            the systems monitor showed both his engines were offline and the ship had switched to back up power generator which would provide him with power for a limited time of seventy-two earth hours. Just then krox came back online</p> 
        <p>"Lord Kronox I’m glad to see you’re okay."</p>
        <p>"Yes, the same here my friend."</p>
        <p>"Sir while we were entering the planet’satmosphere, I detected a device orbiting the planet which the humans call a satellite. They use it to monitor and track people and objects, I tapped into the device's central unit before I went offline. Perhaps we can use it to locate the boy."</p>
        <p>"Do what you can krox, I’ll see that the ship's engines are repaired, we do not have much time."</p>
