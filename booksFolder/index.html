        using position absolute and z indexing it with the about content 
    
        i think i'll just use a gradient div on the background till i learn enough JavaScript.
        i need to switch the image to a potrait one in javascript with i can't achieve now-->

            <p> SOMEWHERE in the vast void of space....</p>
            <p>Kronox’s space craft burst through a wormhole. The ship was smoking and spiraling out of control, inside the ship kronox was at the deck franticly pressing different buttons trying to get the ship under control.</p>
            <p>"Krox, what’s the status of the ship?",</p>
            <p>Krox was the AI designated for kronox's ship.</p>
            <p>"Sir the ship's engines sustained considerable damage, navigation and landing protocols are offline as well",</p>
            <p>"So that means that we'll be crashlanding"</p>
            <p>"Precisely sir."</p>
            <p>"But can we still make it to our destination?"</p>
            <p>"I believe so sir."</p>
            <p>"Then prepare the pod."</p>
            <p>Looking at the main screen of his ship kronox saw earth's silver outline as he approached the planet hoping he would complete his mission, his life and probably his entire planet depended on it.</p>
